goal: Write a recursive function that accepts a number, and will count up to that number in fizzbuzz. Fizzbuzz: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz

code:
function fizzbuzz(numToCountTo, currNum = 1) {
	exit condition, exit if currNum is greater than numToCountTo

	if/else block to follow rules of fizzbuzz, using currNum

	increment currNum and call on ourself/recurse
}
