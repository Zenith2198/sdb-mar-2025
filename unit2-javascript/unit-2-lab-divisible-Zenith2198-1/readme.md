# Divisible

# Objective

## Learning

In this exercise, we will practice using conditional logic, Boolean values, and the Remainder `%` operator (also called the modulo operator)

Topics

- [`%` Remainder operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder)
- [`if...else` statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else)
- Boolean values `true` and `false`

## Achieving

In this exercise, we will create a program that takes two numbers and determines if the first number is evenly divisible by the second, outputting `true` or `false` accordingly.

Your work will result in:

- Two variables to store your dividend and divisor numbers
- A remainder variable to store the result of the modulo operation
- `if...else` conditional logic to output `true` or `false`
- A program that correctly identifies whether one number is evenly divisible by the other

# Procedure

## Set up the variables
- [ ] Create a `dividend` variable and assign it a number of your choice
- [ ] Create a `divisor` variable and assign it a number of your choice
- [ ] Create a `remainder` variable and assign it the value of `dividend % divisor`
- [ ] Print the value of your `remainder` variable to verify it's what you expect

## Create the conditional logic
- [ ] Write an `if` statement to check if the remainder equals 0
- [ ] If remainder is 0, print `true`
- [ ] Add an `else` statement to print `false` when the remainder is not 0

## Test your code
- [ ] Try different number combinations for dividend and divisor
- [ ] Print the results to the terminal

# Review

In this exercise, we practiced using `if...else` conditional logic and the Remainder `%` operator. Your code should:
  - Take two numbers and output the Boolean `true` if the first number is evenly divisible by the second, and `false` if they are not evenly divisible.
 
## Going Further

- How many different ways can you solve this?
- Try using the following approaches
  - Equality operator and remainder
  - Remainder operator only
  - Ternary operator
